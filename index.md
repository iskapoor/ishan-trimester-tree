### Tech Talk Notes

TT0 - Paradigms:
Paradigms are a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
Imperative paradigms: Uses statements to change a programâ€™s state. Imperative programs are built from procedures and a series of commands to perform a task.
Object Oriented paradigms: Uses classes as blueprints to make objects out of. These class structures can be reused, and Java follows OOP.

TT1 - Linked Lists P.2
- enqueue means append to list
- dequeue means remove the first elemet from a list
- Queue has head and tail: head is the first element in the linked list and tail is the last element
- After adding one element, the head remains the same, the tail changes
- When removing an element, the tail remains the same, the head changes

Future Plans for TT - I plan to review over the concepts alongside my scrum team 

### Test Prep Plans

- I will study alongside other members of our group to review key knowledge for the AP exam
- I will distribute my study time as per the allocation of points shown by CollegeBoard
- I will help akhil... or smth like that
