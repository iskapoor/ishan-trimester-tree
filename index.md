### Tech Talk Notes

TT0 - Paradigms:
Paradigms are a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
Imperative paradigms: Uses statements to change a programâ€™s state. Imperative programs are built from procedures and a series of commands to perform a task.
Object Oriented paradigms: Uses classes as blueprints to make objects out of. These class structures can be reused, and Java follows OOP.

TT1 - Linked Lists P.2
- enqueue means append to list
- dequeue means remove the first elemet from a list
- Queue has head and tail: head is the first element in the linked list and tail is the last element
- After adding one element, the head remains the same, the tail changes
- When removing an element, the tail remains the same, the head changes

TT2 
- calculator class has toString that returns the mathematic result
- Tokenize - string to math expression
- Example: 200 + 100 to 200, +, 100
- Reverse Polish Notation: used in older computers as input for math, we take the Tokenize list and convert it to this
- We create operators and separators hashmaps and give each thing a precedence

TT3
- Sort algorithms will measure time in ns, gather 12 runs and take average of every data point but high and low
- We need to test multiple runtimes so we can get a accurate value from enough data.

Future Plans for TT - I plan to review over the concepts alongside my scrum team 

### Test Prep Plans

- I will study alongside other members of our group to review key knowledge for the AP exam
- I will distribute my study time as per the allocation of points shown by CollegeBoard
- I will help akhil... or smth like that

### Code Snippets

TT0: 
I struggled with HashMaps

I also enjoyed working through the try catch logic for the Menu

TT1:
Linked Lists are lists of vars where each variable is connected in an order such that you can identify what's before and after it based on it.

I have comments, implementation of add and delete (can be seen running on replit)

Below is the printQueue method, we can take 2 int lists and run a simple double for loop to order them into one list. Afterwards, we can convert to Object list and feed into this method to print.

This is my tester and the reverse order test case from Queue to Stack is in it.

### Reflection For Calculator

My key points of reflection:
- Tokenizing an expression was an interesting challenge; to take a string and identify parts then split it on the basis of those components

- I overcame that challege by identitfying spaces and seperating tokens from the start of the remaining string to the character before the space until the string if finished.
- RPN was also an interesting logic point. It was fun to work through the logic and address the stack vs queue orderings.
